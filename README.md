The role of the Academy is to work on all athleteâ€™s skills, fitness progression, discipline on the field, coping with pressure and decision making. This is done to ensure that each individual athlete understands their role in the team as well as to develop them as well-rounded individuals. 

The rugby academy works with Headstrong Consulting who provides their athletes with a sports psychology program which recognises the importance of providing structure, education and professional guidance.  

The purpose of this project is to develop a new management application for the Western Province Rugby Academy. The system will include the creation of an application which will support mobile devices for management purposes. The application will allow the rugby coaches full control and easy communication over the day-to-day activities, training sessions, record keeping and management capabilities. The application system will include a section for the rugby players to view their weekly timetable, match fixtures and the teams which will be playing in the matches.
