      men. This program which is implemented in their training is supported by a
      diet and an expert lifestyle management process.

      The purpose of this project is to develop a new management application for the
      Western Province Rugby Academy. The system will include the creation of an
      application which will support mobile devices for management purposes. The
      application will allow the rugby coaches full control and easy communication
      over the day-to-day activities, training sessions, record keeping and
      management capabilities. The application system will include a section for
      the rugby players to view their weekly timetable, match fixtures and the teams
      which will be playing in the matches.
